# This script was modified from Andrina Kelly's version presented at JNUC2013 for allowing
# a user to elevate their privelages to administrator once per day for 30 minutes. After 
# the 30 minutes if a user created a new admin account that account will have admin rights
# also revoked. If the user changed the organization admin account password, that will also
# be reset.
#
# To accomplish this the following will be performed:
#			- A launch daemon will be put in place in order to remove admin rights
#			- Log will be written to tempAdmin.log
#			- This policy in Jamf will be set to only be allowed once per day
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#			- Jamf Pro
#			- Policy for enabling tempAdmin via Self Service
#			- Policy to remove tempAdmin via custom trigger
#			- tempAdmin.sh & removeTempAdmin.sh Scripts
#           - orgAdmin encrypted password specified in Jamf Pro parameter #4
